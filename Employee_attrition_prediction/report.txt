HR Attrition Analysis and Prediction Report
1. Dataset Overview
This dataset, derived from IBM HR analytics, contains employee information for predicting attrition.
It includes demographic, behavioral, and performance features across 1,470 employee records.
The target variable is ‘Attrition’, which indicates whether an employee has left the company (Yes/No).

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Around 16% of employees have left the organization.

Higher attrition is observed among:

Employees with low income

Those doing frequent overtime

Employees with short tenure

Employees with low job satisfaction or poor work-life balance

Younger employees and those lacking promotions tend to leave more frequently.

3. Key Features Influencing Attrition

Feature	Insight
MonthlyIncome	Lower income is associated with higher attrition.
OverTime	Frequent overtime increases attrition risk.
JobSatisfaction	Dissatisfied employees tend to leave.
YearsAtCompany	Employees with <2 years tenure are more likely to leave.
WorkLifeBalance	Poor balance correlates with higher attrition.
EnvironmentSatisfaction	Lower satisfaction = higher attrition.
Age	Younger staff have higher mobility and are more prone to leave.
4. Feature Engineering
To better capture behavior patterns, new features were created:

Rate_to_income: Ratio of DailyRate to MonthlyIncome.

Income_per_hour: Approximate hourly earnings.

Working_years_per_company: Career spread.

Promotion_frequency: Promotions vs. tenure.

Distance_JobSatisfaction: Combined impact of commute and satisfaction.

WorkLife_Satisfaction: Composite indicator of employee happiness.

JobStability_Score: Tenure relative to age.

SkillInvestment_Score: Education vs. tenure.

Stress_score: Composite of overtime and workload.

Engagement_Score: Satisfaction and environment measure.

PerformanceToReward: Links performance rating and compensation fairness.

5. Modeling Process
Model Used: Gradient Boosting Classifier (best from GridSearchCV).

Preprocessing:

StandardScaler for numerical data.

LabelEncoding & OneHotEncoding for categorical variables.

Performance:

Accuracy: ~88%

Precision & Recall: Balanced, F1-score ≈ 0.78

ROC-AUC: 0.84+

6. Factors Increasing Attrition
High OverTime (burnout)

Low Monthly Income

Short YearsAtCompany

Poor WorkLife Balance

Low JobSatisfaction

Fewer promotions or recognitions

Poor performance reward alignment

7. Factors Reducing Attrition
High Environment and Job Satisfaction

Competitive and fair compensation

Balanced work hours and stress

Longer tenure and engagement

Frequent promotions

Good skill investment and learning support

8. Web Application Integration
A Flask-based web interface was created for HR teams. It:

Accepts 20 numeric input features from employees.

Predicts attrition with a single click.

Is user-friendly, visually clean, and easily extendable.

Can be used for real-time decision-making and HR monitoring.

9. Conclusion & Recommendations
The model is effective in identifying at-risk employees.

Key recommendations:

Improve satisfaction and work-life balance policies.

Closely monitor employees during the first 2 years.

Recognize contributions with promotions or raises.

Minimize unnecessary overtime and stress.

Future Scope:

Incorporate text-based sentiment analysis from HR surveys.

Use SHAP/ELI5 to explain individual predictions.

Integrate into a dashboard for live employee monitoring.
