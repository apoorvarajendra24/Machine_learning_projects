
üìö Full Assignment: Employee Attrition Prediction using Logistic Regression
1. üéØ Problem Statement
Predict whether an employee will leave the company (Attrition: Yes/No).

Use Logistic Regression.

Handle class imbalance.

Maximize metrics like ROC-AUC, Recall, and Precision (attrition prediction prefers high Recall to catch most leavers).

2. üõ†Ô∏è Steps and Detailed Assignments
‚û°Ô∏è STEP 1: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Assignments:

Check dataset shape, columns, info(), and describe().

Find missing values and handle them if any.

Understand distribution of each feature (use histograms, countplots).

Perform correlation analysis (for numeric features).

Analyze relationships between categorical variables and Attrition:

Example: Attrition vs Department, Attrition vs OverTime, etc.

Identify outliers (using boxplots).

Deliverables:

5-10 visualizations to understand the data.

A written EDA summary ‚Äî key findings about attrition patterns.

‚û°Ô∏è STEP 2: Data Preprocessing
Assignments:

Encode categorical variables:

Binary categories: Label Encoding (e.g., OverTime ‚Üí Yes/No).

Multi-categories: OneHotEncoding (e.g., JobRole, Department).

Feature Scaling:

Scale numerical features like Age, MonthlyIncome, DistanceFromHome (use StandardScaler).

Handle Class Imbalance:

Use SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique) or

Use class_weight="balanced" in LogisticRegression.

Feature Selection:

Drop highly correlated features (correlation > 0.9).

Select important features (using domain knowledge + correlation study).

Deliverables:

Code for encoding and scaling.

New clean dataset ready for modeling.

‚û°Ô∏è STEP 3: Model Building - Logistic Regression
Assignments:

Split the data into Train and Test sets (test_size=20-30%).

Train a basic Logistic Regression model.

Evaluate basic model performance.

Deliverables:

Training, prediction, and basic evaluation results.

‚û°Ô∏è STEP 4: Model Evaluation
Assignments:

Generate:

Confusion Matrix

Classification Report (Precision, Recall, F1-score)

ROC Curve

AUC Score

Focus on Recall and AUC for model performance because missing an employee who will leave is costly for companies.

Deliverables:

ROC Curve plot

Confusion matrix heatmap

Interpretation of Precision, Recall, F1, and AUC values

‚û°Ô∏è STEP 5: Hyperparameter Tuning
Assignments:

Perform GridSearchCV or RandomizedSearchCV:

Important hyperparameters to tune:

penalty (l1, l2)

C (inverse of regularization strength)

solver (liblinear, saga)

Choose the best hyperparameters.

Retrain Logistic Regression with the best parameters.

Deliverables:

Best model hyperparameters

Performance comparison: before vs after tuning.

‚û°Ô∏è STEP 6: Model Interpretation
Assignments:

Analyze feature importance (model coefficients).

Identify the most impactful features leading to employee attrition.

Discuss how HR can act on these insights.

Deliverables:

A table of important features.

Insights into "what causes employees to leave."

‚û°Ô∏è STEP 7: Final Model Evaluation
Assignments:

Final confusion matrix, ROC, classification report after tuning.

Evaluate the model on unseen test data.

Conclusion about model performance.

Deliverables:

Final accuracy, precision, recall, F1, ROC-AUC on test data.

‚û°Ô∏è STEP 8: Bonus (Optional but HIGHLY Recommended)
Assignments:

Use SMOTE + Logistic Regression to see if Recall improves.

Try PolynomialFeatures (degree 2) for logistic regression (to capture non-linearity).

Prepare a clean and attractive PowerPoint or Report explaining the project flow.

üìÅ Final Deliverables
At the end, you should have:

EDA_notebook.ipynb

Preprocessing_and_Modeling.ipynb

Hyperparameter_Tuning.ipynb

Final_Report.pptx or .md file summarizing findings

(Optional) Dashboard using Streamlit or Power BI

üìà Metrics to Optimize

Metric	Importance	Why
Recall	High	Better to catch as many leavers as possible
ROC-AUC	High	Good separation between classes
Precision	Medium	Ensure not many false positives
üìå Quick Tip:
Don't only chase accuracy!
Since the data is imbalanced, high recall + decent precision + high AUC is what you should aim for!

üöÄ Tools to Use
Python

Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Imbalanced-learn (for SMOTE)

Jupyter Notebook / Colab
