ðŸ“‹ Advanced EDA Mini-Challenges

1. Find a Combination of Two Features that Together Strongly Predict Attrition.
Example: Employees with Low Job Satisfaction and OverTime = Yes â€” what is their attrition rate compared to others?

2. Create a New Feature:
"Years in Current Role" divided by "Years at Company",
then check if a lower ratio is associated with higher attrition.

3. Analyze the Interaction between Education Level and Job Role:
Which combination has the highest attrition?

4. Find if Employees with Low Performance Rating and High Training Times still leave.
5. Check if Employees with High Environment Satisfaction but Low Income still leave.
6. Identify if Attrition is higher for Employees with:
Less than 2 Years in Current Role

AND More than 10 Years in the Company.

(Indicating possible stagnation.)

7. Analyze Whether Employees who Travel Frequently and have High Distance From Home are Leaving More.
8. Segment the Dataset by Age Groups:
<30, 30â€“40, 40â€“50, >50
and analyze how Attrition changes across age bands.

9. Check if there is a "Sweet Spot" for Monthly Income where Attrition is lowest (mid-range salaries).
10. Find the 5 Features Most Strongly Associated with Attrition Using:
Chi-Square test (for categorical)

T-test/ANOVA (for numerical)

ðŸ”¥ Bonus "Thinking" Challenge
Design a Feature that could better explain Attrition that isn't already directly in the data.

Example prompts:

"DistanceFromHome Ã— BusinessTravel frequency"

"WorkLifeBalance score adjusted for OverTime"

ðŸŽ¯ Purpose:
These harder assignments force you to think beyond single columns â€”
they train you to look at combinations, hidden patterns, and subgroups.
